# ASUPERSYNC Rust Integration Plan + Module Boundary Skeleton

Bead: `bd-2gi.27.4` [ASUPERSYNC-D]
Subsystem: `fp-runtime` asupersync module decomposition, trait design, and implementation sequencing
Source anchors:
- `ASUPERSYNC_ANCHOR_MAP.md` (bd-2gi.27.1)
- `ASUPERSYNC_CONTRACT_TABLE.md` (bd-2gi.27.2)
- `ASUPERSYNC_THREAT_MODEL.md` (bd-2gi.27.3)

---

## 1. Summary

This document translates the behavioral contracts, threat model, and anchor map
produced by ASUPERSYNC beads A/B/C into concrete Rust module boundaries, trait
definitions, type skeletons, and a phased implementation sequence.

**Scope:** The ASUPERSYNC subsystem provides artifact replication and recovery
via RaptorQ erasure coding, an async transport abstraction, integrity
verification with SHA-256 sidecar validation, and a recovery workflow with
configurable retry policies. All of this integrates into the `fp-runtime` crate
under the existing `asupersync` feature flag, interacting with the `Cx`
capability context for authority control and the conformance harness for
end-to-end verification.

**Goals:**
1. Define module boundaries that enforce separation of concerns (codec, transport,
   integrity, recovery, config) with minimal cross-module coupling.
2. Specify traits with full Rust signatures so that implementors have a clear
   contract and test harnesses can substitute mock implementations.
3. Sequence implementation phases so that each phase produces testable artifacts
   and no phase depends on unfinished work from a later phase.
4. Remediate the INV-NO-AMBIENT-AUTHORITY violation (ATS-3.1) as the first
   concrete code change.

**Status update (2026-02-15, HazyBridge):** Phase-1 module-boundary skeleton is
now implemented under `crates/fp-runtime/src/asupersync/` with feature-gated
wiring in `fp-runtime/src/lib.rs`. This includes concrete `config`, `error`,
`codec`, `integrity`, `transport`, and `recovery` seams intended to unblock
`bd-2gi.27.5`.

**Status update (2026-02-15, PearlStream):** `bd-2gi.27.6` landed deterministic
differential/forensics replay metadata and a feature-gated conformance hook for
ASUPERSYNC codec/integrity evidence in `crates/fp-conformance/src/lib.rs`
(`replay_key`, `trace_id`, `mismatch_class`, `scenario_id`, `step_id`,
`decision_action`, measured `elapsed_us`, plus optional `asupersync_codec`
evidence on sidecar artifacts).

**Status update (2026-02-15, PearlStream):** `bd-2gi.27.8` landed a profile-led
runtime hot-path optimization in `crates/fp-runtime/src/lib.rs`:
`EvidenceTerm.name` now uses `Cow<'static, str>` and join-admission evidence/loss
coefficients are static constants (`JOIN_ADMISSION_EVIDENCE_*`,
`JOIN_ADMISSION_LOSS`) instead of per-decision owned string construction. The
change is gated by two new proofs:
- `asupersync_join_admission_optimized_path_is_isomorphic_to_baseline`
- `asupersync_join_admission_profile_snapshot_reports_allocation_delta`

Snapshot metrics from `rch exec -- cargo test -p fp-runtime --lib asupersync_join_admission_profile_snapshot_reports_allocation_delta -- --nocapture`:
- Baseline `p50/p95/p99` (ns): `430 / 571 / 5029`
- Optimized `p50/p95/p99` (ns): `380 / 2695 / 4458`
- Deterministic name-allocation delta across 256 decisions: `11008 -> 0` bytes

**Status update (2026-02-15, PearlStream):** `bd-2gi.27.9` evidence-pack closure
now hardens decode-proof pairing in `verify_packet_sidecar_integrity()`:
decode-proof hashes in `parity_report.decode_proof.json` must be present in
`parity_report.raptorq.json` envelope proofs and carry `sha256:` prefixes.
Regression proof: `sidecar_integrity_fails_when_decode_proof_hash_mismatches_sidecar`.

**Non-goals:** This document does not specify FTUI dashboard integration
(deferred to FrankenTUI beads). It does not design the full Cx capability
threading through the FrankenPandas call stack (deferred to a separate Cx
integration bead).

## 2. Current Integration State

### 2.1 What Exists in fp-runtime

The `fp-runtime` crate (`crates/fp-runtime/src/lib.rs`, 922 lines) contains:

| Component | Lines | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `RuntimeMode`, `DecisionAction`, `IssueKind` enums | 1-30 | Stable |
| `CompatibilityIssue`, `EvidenceTerm`, `LossMatrix` types | 32-67 | Stable |
| `DecisionMetrics`, `DecisionRecord` types | 69-87 | Stable |
| `GalaxyBrainCard` + `decision_to_card()` | 89-121 | Stable |
| `EvidenceLedger` (append-only) | 123-144 | Stable |
| `RuntimePolicy` (strict/hardened) | 146-256 | Stable + 27.8 hot-path optimization |
| `RuntimeError::ClockSkew` + `now_unix_ms()` | 258-270 | **Violation site** (ATS-3.1) |
| `decide()` (Bayesian engine) | 272-322 | Stable (calls `now_unix_ms`) |
| `RaptorQEnvelope`, `RaptorQMetadata`, `ScrubStatus`, `DecodeProof` | 324-376 | Placeholder-only |
| `ConformalGuard` + `ConformalPredictionSet` | 378-551 | Stable |
| `outcome_to_action()` (feature-gated) | 553-563 | Stable, gated on `asupersync` |
| Tests (27 test functions) | 565-1324 | Passing |

### 2.2 Feature Flag Status

```toml
# crates/fp-runtime/Cargo.toml
[features]
default = []
asupersync = ["dep:asupersync"]

[dependencies]
asupersync = { version = "0.1.1", optional = true, default-features = false }
```

- The `asupersync` feature is **default-off**. No other workspace crate enables it.
- When enabled, only `outcome_to_action()` is compiled (6 lines of feature-gated code).
- The RaptorQ envelope types are **not** feature-gated; they are structural placeholders
  available unconditionally.

### 2.3 fp-conformance Integration

The `fp-conformance` crate already performs real RaptorQ encode/decode using the
`raptorq` crate (not `asupersync`). It defines:

- `RaptorQSidecarArtifact` -- wraps `RaptorQEnvelope` with OTI data and packet records
- `RaptorQPacketRecord` -- individual encoded symbol metadata
- `RaptorQScrubReport` -- integrity verification result
- `generate_raptorq_sidecar()` -- encodes payloads with repair symbols
- `run_raptorq_decode_recovery_drill()` -- drops source packets and recovers via repair
- `verify_raptorq_sidecar()` -- validates packet hashes against source data

As of `bd-2gi.27.6`, the conformance path now includes:

- feature flag plumbing in `fp-conformance` (`asupersync = ["fp-runtime/asupersync"]`),
- optional sidecar field `asupersync_codec` with codec/verifier evidence,
- feature-gated calls that exercise `PassthroughCodec` (`ArtifactCodec`) and
  `Fnv1aVerifier` (`IntegrityVerifier`) during sidecar generation/verification.

This keeps the default RaptorQ flow stable while allowing feature-on harness runs
to execute the same trait boundaries used by ASUPERSYNC runtime modules.

### 2.4 Current Test Coverage

| Area | Tests | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Outcome bridge | 0 (feature off by default) | Would need `--features asupersync` |
| Decision engine (strict) | 1 | `strict_mode_fails_closed_for_unknown_features` |
| Decision engine (hardened) | 1 | `hardened_mode_repairs_large_join_estimates` |
| Decision engine isomorphism/perf (ASUPERSYNC-H) | 2 | Baseline-vs-optimized parity + profile snapshot |
| RaptorQ placeholder | 1 | `placeholder_raptorq_envelope_is_well_formed` |
| Conformal guard | 11 | AG-09-T suite, comprehensive |
| Galaxy brain card | 2 | Rendering + content checks |
| RaptorQ real encode/decode | 3 (in fp-conformance) | Sidecar generation, drill, scrub |

**Gap:** No tests exercise `now_unix_ms()` clock failure; outcome bridge tests
still require `--features asupersync`; and full feature-on integration CI is
currently constrained by upstream `asupersync` dependency compile blockers.

---

## 3. Module Boundary Design

### 3.1 Module Hierarchy

All new modules reside under `crates/fp-runtime/src/asupersync/`. A new
`mod asupersync` is added to `lib.rs`, gated on `#[cfg(feature = "asupersync")]`
at the module level (not per-item). Types that must remain available without
the feature flag (e.g., `RaptorQEnvelope`) stay in `lib.rs`.

```
crates/fp-runtime/src/
  lib.rs                     # existing: public API, re-exports
  clock.rs                   # NEW: Clock trait (NOT feature-gated)
  asupersync/                # NEW: feature-gated module tree
    mod.rs                   # re-exports, module-level docs
    codec.rs                 # RaptorQ encode/decode with fallback
    transport.rs             # async send/receive abstraction
    integrity.rs             # SHA-256 verification, sidecar validation
    recovery.rs              # recovery workflow, retry logic
    config.rs                # configuration types, capability reqs
    error.rs                 # AsupersyncError enum
```

**Rationale for `clock.rs` outside feature gate:** The Clock trait is needed to
remediate INV-NO-AMBIENT-AUTHORITY regardless of whether asupersync is enabled.
The decision engine must accept an injectable clock even in the base configuration.

        Ok(self.current_ms.load(std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst))
    }
}
```

### 4.2 `ArtifactCodec`

```rust
/// Encode and decode artifact payloads using erasure coding.
///
/// Implementations provide RaptorQ (or other FEC) encoding with configurable
/// redundancy. The codec operates on byte slices and produces `EncodedArtifact`
/// bundles containing source + repair symbols.
///
/// Contract: CON-CODEC-ROUNDTRIP -- for any payload P and codec C,

    fn encode(

        artifact_id: &str,
        artifact_type: &str,
        payload: &[u8],
        config: &CodecConfig,
    ) -> Result<EncodedArtifact, AsupersyncError>;

    /// Decode an `EncodedArtifact` back to the original payload.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    /// - `artifact`: The encoded artifact containing symbols and OTI.
    ///
    /// # Errors

    /// Returns `AsupersyncError::IntegrityFailure` if decoded payload hash
    /// does not match `artifact.source_hash`.
    fn decode(
        &self,
        artifact: &EncodedArtifact,
    ) -> Result<Vec<u8>, AsupersyncError>;

    /// Return the minimum number of symbols required for successful decode.
    fn min_symbols_for_decode(&self, artifact: &EncodedArtifact) -> u32;
}
```

### 4.3 `TransportLayer`

```rust
/// Async artifact transfer abstraction.
///
/// Implementations handle the network or IPC layer for sending/receiving
/// encoded artifacts. The trait is async to support non-blocking IO under
/// the asupersync runtime.
///
/// Contract: CON-TRANSPORT-DELIVERY -- a `send()` that returns `Ok(report)`
/// with `report.status == TransferStatus::Complete` guarantees that all
/// symbols were accepted by the remote receiver. The receiver may still
/// fail to decode if symbols are corrupted in transit (integrity check
/// is the caller's responsibility).
#[async_trait::async_trait]
pub trait TransportLayer: Send + Sync {
    /// Send an encoded artifact to one or more destinations.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    /// - `cx`: Capability context for cancellation and budget enforcement.
    /// - `artifact`: The encoded artifact to transfer.
    /// - `destinations`: Target endpoint identifiers.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    /// Returns `AsupersyncError::TransportSend` on network failure.
    /// Returns `AsupersyncError::Cancelled` if `cx` cancellation fires.
    /// Returns `AsupersyncError::BudgetExhausted` if deadline/quota exceeded.
    async fn send(

    ///
    /// # Parameters

        artifact_id: &str,
        source: &str,
    ) -> Result<EncodedArtifact, AsupersyncError>;
}
```

### 4.4 `IntegrityVerifier`

```rust
/// Hash verification for artifact payloads and encoded symbols.
///
/// Implementations compute and verify SHA-256 (or other) hashes for:
/// 1. Source payload integrity (pre-encode / post-decode)
/// 2. Individual symbol integrity (per-packet hash in sidecar)
/// 3. Sidecar manifest consistency (all hashes match recorded values)
///
/// Contract: CON-INTEGRITY-DETERMINISTIC -- for any payload P,
/// `verify(P, hash(P))` must always return `VerificationResult::Valid`.
/// `verify(P, hash(Q))` where P != Q must always return
/// `VerificationResult::Invalid`.

    /// (e.g., "sha256:abcdef...").

    /// Verify that a payload matches an expected hash string.
    fn verify_payload(
        &self,
        payload: &[u8],
        expected_hash: &str,
    ) -> VerificationResult;

    /// Verify all entries in a sidecar manifest against actual symbol data.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    /// Returns `AsupersyncError::IntegrityFailure` with details on first
    /// mismatched symbol. In strict mode, verification stops at first failure.
    /// In hardened mode, all symbols are checked and all failures reported.
    fn verify_sidecar(
        &self,
        manifest: &SidecarManifest,
        mode: crate::RuntimeMode,
    ) -> Result<VerificationResult, AsupersyncError>;
}
```

### 4.5 `RecoveryPolicy`

```rust
/// Strategy for artifact recovery when decode or transfer fails.
///
/// Implementations define retry logic, backoff schedules, and escalation
/// behavior. The policy respects INV-SUPERVISION-MONOTONE: panicked
/// operations are never retried.
///
/// Contract: CON-RECOVERY-MONOTONE -- if `should_retry()` is called with
/// `RecoveryOutcome::Panicked`, it must return `false`. This is enforced
/// by a debug assertion in the default implementation.
pub trait RecoveryPolicy: Send + Sync {
    /// Determine whether a failed operation should be retried.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    /// - `outcome`: The outcome of the previous attempt.
    /// - `attempt`: The current attempt number (1-indexed).
    /// - `plan`: The recovery plan with budget and constraints.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// `true` if the operation should be retried; `false` to give up.
    fn should_retry(

        plan: &RecoveryPlan,
    ) -> bool;

    /// Compute the delay before the next retry attempt.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    /// - `attempt`: The current attempt number (1-indexed).
    /// - `plan`: The recovery plan with budget and constraints.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// Delay in milliseconds. Returns 0 for immediate retry.
    fn retry_delay_ms(
        &self,
        attempt: u32,
        plan: &RecoveryPlan,
    ) -> u64;

    /// Maximum number of retry attempts before escalation.
    fn max_attempts(&self, plan: &RecoveryPlan) -> u32;

## 5. Type Skeleton

### 5.1 Existing Types (Verification)

#### `RaptorQEnvelope` (VERIFIED CORRECT)

```rust
// crates/fp-runtime/src/lib.rs lines 324-376
// NO CHANGES NEEDED to struct fields.
// Additions needed: impl blocks for real encode integration (Phase 1).
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct RaptorQEnvelope {
    pub artifact_id: String,
    pub artifact_type: String,
    pub source_hash: String,          // "sha256:..." or "blake3:placeholder"
    pub raptorq: RaptorQMetadata,
    pub scrub: ScrubStatus,
    pub decode_proofs: Vec<DecodeProof>,
}
```

**Verification notes:**
- The `source_hash` field uses prefix-based format discrimination (`"sha256:"` for
  real, `"blake3:placeholder"` for placeholder). This is correct per CON-PLACEHOLDER-SENTINEL.
- The `decode_proofs` vector is unbounded. Per R-07, a `MAX_DECODE_PROOFS` cap should
  be added in Phase 1.

#### `DecodeProof` (NEEDS EXTENSION)

```rust
// Current (lib.rs lines 348-354):
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct DecodeProof {
    pub ts_unix_ms: u64,
    pub reason: String,
    pub recovered_blocks: u32,
    pub proof_hash: String,
}

// Planned additions (Phase 1, per R-04):
// pub artifact_id: String,   // bind proof to specific artifact
// pub nonce: u64,            // prevent cross-artifact replay
```

### 5.2 New Types

#### `SidecarManifest`

```rust
/// Manifest of an encoded artifact's symbol inventory with per-symbol hashes.
///
/// Used by `IntegrityVerifier::verify_sidecar()` to validate that all symbols
/// in a transferred artifact match their recorded hashes.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct SidecarManifest {
    /// Artifact identifier this manifest belongs to.
    pub artifact_id: String,
    /// Artifact type category.
    pub artifact_type: String,
    /// SHA-256 hash of the original source payload (prefixed: "sha256:...").
    pub source_hash: String,
    /// Number of source symbols (k parameter).
    pub source_symbol_count: u32,
    /// Number of repair symbols.
    pub repair_symbol_count: u32,
    /// Per-symbol hash entries, in encoding order.
    pub symbol_hashes: Vec<SymbolHashEntry>,
    /// Object Transmission Information for RaptorQ decoder.
    pub oti_hex: String,
    /// Timestamp when manifest was generated.
    pub generated_at_unix_ms: u64,
    /// Nonce for replay prevention.
    pub nonce: u64,
}

/// Hash entry for a single encoded symbol.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct SymbolHashEntry {
    /// Source block number.
    pub source_block_number: u8,
    /// Encoding Symbol ID within the block.
    pub encoding_symbol_id: u32,
    /// Whether this is a source (true) or repair (false) symbol.
    pub is_source: bool,
    /// SHA-256 hash of the serialized symbol data.
    pub symbol_hash: String,
}
```

#### `RecoveryPlan`

```rust
/// Configuration for a recovery workflow attempt.
///
/// Specifies retry budgets, backoff parameters, and escalation thresholds.
/// The plan is consumed by `RecoveryPolicy` implementations to make
/// retry/abandon decisions.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct RecoveryPlan {
    /// Maximum number of retry attempts.
    pub max_retries: u32,
    /// Initial backoff delay in milliseconds.
    pub initial_backoff_ms: u64,
    /// Maximum backoff delay in milliseconds.
    pub max_backoff_ms: u64,
    /// Backoff multiplier (e.g., 2.0 for exponential).
    pub backoff_multiplier: f64,
    /// Wall-clock deadline in milliseconds since epoch (0 = no deadline).
    pub deadline_unix_ms: u64,
    /// Whether to attempt alternate sources on failure.
    pub try_alternate_sources: bool,
    /// Alternate source endpoints to try if primary fails.
    pub alternate_sources: Vec<String>,
    /// Runtime mode governing fail-closed behavior.

```

---

## 7. Implementation Sequencing

### Phase 1: Clock + Codec + Integrity (Pure Computation, No IO)

**Estimated scope:** ~300-400 LOC implementation + ~200 LOC tests
**Duration:** 1 sprint

**Deliverables:**
1. `clock.rs` -- `Clock` trait, `SystemClock`, `FakeClock`
2. Refactor `now_unix_ms()` to use `Clock` trait; update `decide()` signature
3. `asupersync/error.rs` -- `AsupersyncError` enum (all variants)
4. `asupersync/codec.rs` -- `ArtifactCodec` trait + `RaptorQCodec` impl
5. `asupersync/integrity.rs` -- `IntegrityVerifier` trait + `Sha256Verifier` impl
6. Extend `DecodeProof` with `artifact_id` and `nonce` fields (R-04)
7. Add `MAX_DECODE_PROOFS` cap to `RaptorQEnvelope` (R-07)
8. Change placeholder `ScrubStatus.status` from `"ok"` to `"placeholder"` (R-08)

**Dependencies:** None. All work is in `fp-runtime` and is pure computation.

**Test strategy:**
- Unit tests for `Clock` trait: `SystemClock` returns non-zero, `FakeClock` is deterministic
- Unit tests for `decide()` with injected `FakeClock`: timestamps are deterministic
- Property tests for `ArtifactCodec`: roundtrip encode/decode for arbitrary payloads
- Unit tests for `IntegrityVerifier`: known SHA-256 vectors, mismatch detection
- Unit tests for `DecodeProof` artifact binding: reject unbound proofs
- Unit tests for decode proof cap: verify truncation at limit

**Breaking changes:**
- `decide()` gains a `clock: &dyn Clock` parameter (internal function, not public API).
- `RuntimePolicy::decide_unknown_feature()` and `decide_join_admission()` gain a
  `clock: &dyn Clock` parameter. These are public API changes. Provide a backward-
  compatible overload or use a builder pattern with `SystemClock` as default.
- `DecodeProof` struct gains two new fields. Add `#[serde(default)]` for backward
  compatibility with existing serialized proofs.
- `ScrubStatus` placeholder value changes from `"ok"` to `"placeholder"`. This
  affects `fp-conformance` tests that assert `scrub.status == "ok"` for placeholders.

### Phase 2: Config + Transport Abstraction (Trait Definitions)

**Estimated scope:** ~200-250 LOC implementation + ~100 LOC tests
**Duration:** 0.5 sprint

**Deliverables:**
1. `asupersync/config.rs` -- `AsupersyncConfig`, `CxCapability`, `CapabilitySet`,
   `OperationRequirements`, `CodecConfig`
2. `asupersync/transport.rs` -- `TransportLayer` trait, `TransferReport`, `TransferStatus`
3. New types: `SidecarManifest`, `SymbolHashEntry`, `EncodedArtifact`, `EncodedSymbol`
4. `asupersync/mod.rs` -- module re-exports

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (error types, codec trait).

**Test strategy:**
- Unit tests for `CapabilitySet::satisfies()` and `missing()`: all combinations
- Unit tests for `AsupersyncConfig::default()`: verify all fields have sensible values
- Unit tests for `TransferReport` serialization roundtrip
- Mock `TransportLayer` implementation for testing (returns canned responses)
- No integration tests yet (no real transport implementation)

**Breaking changes:** None (all new types, feature-gated).

### Phase 3: Recovery Workflow (Depends on Phase 1 + 2)

**Estimated scope:** ~250-300 LOC implementation + ~150 LOC tests
**Duration:** 1 sprint

**Deliverables:**
1. `asupersync/recovery.rs` -- `RecoveryPolicy` trait, `RecoveryPlan`,
   `RecoveryOutcome`, `DefaultRecoveryPolicy`
2. Recovery orchestrator function that combines codec decode, integrity check,
   transport fetch, and retry logic
3. INV-SUPERVISION-MONOTONE enforcement: debug assertion that `Panicked` outcomes
   are never retried
4. Error classification hook: distinguish transient from permanent errors (R-05)

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (codec, integrity, error types), Phase 2 (transport trait,
config types).

**Test strategy:**
- Unit tests for `DefaultRecoveryPolicy::should_retry()`:
  - Returns `false` for `RecoveryOutcome::Panicked` (monotonicity)
  - Returns `false` when `attempt >= max_retries`
  - Returns `true` for transient errors within budget
  - Returns `false` for permanent errors
- Unit tests for `retry_delay_ms()`: exponential backoff calculation
- Unit tests for recovery orchestrator:
  - Succeeds on first attempt when all symbols present
  - Retries and succeeds when transport fails once then succeeds
  - Gives up after max retries
  - Respects deadline (with FakeClock)
- Property test: retry count never exceeds `max_retries + 1`

**Breaking changes:** None (all new types, feature-gated).

### Phase 4: Integration Tests + Conformance Harness Hooks

**Estimated scope:** ~200-300 LOC tests + ~50 LOC harness glue
**Duration:** 0.5 sprint

**Deliverables:**
1. Integration test: encode artifact -> transfer (mock) -> receive -> decode -> verify
2. Integration test: encode -> drop symbols -> recover via recovery workflow
3. Conformance harness hook: `fp-conformance` uses `ArtifactCodec` trait instead
   of direct `raptorq` crate calls (optional migration, non-breaking)
4. Feature-gated integration test for `outcome_to_action` bridge with real
   `asupersync::Outcome` values
5. CI configuration for `--features asupersync` test matrix

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 + 2 + 3 all complete.

**Test strategy:**
- End-to-end integration tests in `crates/fp-runtime/tests/`
- Cross-crate integration test if needed (fp-runtime + fp-conformance)
- Conformance harness: verify `generate_raptorq_sidecar` produces artifacts
  that pass `IntegrityVerifier::verify_sidecar()`
- CI: separate test job with `--features asupersync` flag

**Breaking changes:** None (new tests only).

### Phase Summary

| Phase | Scope | Duration | Depends On | Key Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Clock + Codec + Integrity | 1 sprint | Nothing | INV-NO-AMBIENT-AUTHORITY remediated |
| 2 | Config + Transport | 0.5 sprint | Phase 1 | Transport trait + config types |
| 3 | Recovery | 1 sprint | Phase 1+2 | Recovery orchestrator |
| 4 | Integration tests | 0.5 sprint | Phase 1+2+3 | End-to-end verification |

---

## 8. Capability Context Integration

### 8.1 Cx Interaction Model

The asupersync `Cx<Caps>` type carries phantom capability flags. FrankenPandas
ASUPERSYNC modules interact with Cx at these points:

| Module | Operation | Required Capabilities | Cx Interaction |
|---|---|---|---|
| `clock` | `Clock::now_unix_ms()` | `TIME` | Under Cx: `cx.time().unix_ms()` |
| `codec` | `ArtifactCodec::encode()` | (none -- pure computation) | `cx.checkpoint()` for cancellation |
| `codec` | `ArtifactCodec::decode()` | (none -- pure computation) | `cx.checkpoint()` for cancellation |
| `transport` | `TransportLayer::send()` | `IO`, `REMOTE` | `cx.scope_with_budget()` for deadline |
| `transport` | `TransportLayer::receive()` | `IO`, `REMOTE` | `cx.scope_with_budget()` for deadline |
| `integrity` | `IntegrityVerifier::verify_sidecar()` | (none -- pure computation) | `cx.checkpoint()` for large manifests |
| `recovery` | Recovery orchestrator | `TIME`, `IO`, `REMOTE` | Full Cx threading for retry delays |

### 8.2 Capability Narrowing

Following the FrankenSQLite pattern, capabilities are narrowed as operations
become more specific:

```
FpFullCaps         = { TIME, IO, SPAWN, RANDOM, REMOTE }
  |
  +-- FpTransportCaps = { TIME, IO, REMOTE }
  |     (for transport.send/receive)
  |
  +-- FpComputeCaps   = { TIME }
  |     (for codec.encode/decode, integrity.verify)
  |
  +-- FpRecoveryCaps  = { TIME, IO, REMOTE }
        (for recovery orchestrator)
```

### 8.3 Fail-Closed on Missing Capabilities

When a required capability is absent from the Cx context:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Strict | Return `AsupersyncError::CapabilityMissing` immediately; do not attempt operation |
| Hardened | Return `AsupersyncError::CapabilityMissing` immediately; log the gap to evidence ledger |

**No capability degradation is permitted.** An operation that requires `IO` must
not silently fall back to a no-op when `IO` is missing. This is the fail-closed
doctrine applied to the capability system.

### 8.4 Pre-Cx Stepping Stone

Before full Cx integration, operations accept an optional `&dyn Clock` parameter
(Phase 1) and use `CapabilitySet` for declarative requirements checking (Phase 2).
This allows test code to verify capability requirements without the full Cx type
parameter machinery.

---

## 9. INV-NO-AMBIENT-AUTHORITY Remediation

### 9.1 The Violation

**Location:** `crates/fp-runtime/src/lib.rs`, line 264-270.

```rust
fn now_unix_ms() -> Result<u64, RuntimeError> {
    let ms = SystemTime::now()           // <-- AMBIENT AUTHORITY
        .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)
        .map_err(|_| RuntimeError::ClockSkew)?
        .as_millis();
    Ok(ms as u64)
}
```

This is the **sole** ambient authority violation in `fp-runtime` (confirmed by
ASUPERSYNC_THREAT_MODEL.md section 5.1, ATS-3.1 severity: HIGH, likelihood:
CERTAIN).

### 9.2 Callers

`now_unix_ms()` is called once, in `decide()` at line 308:

```rust
ts_unix_ms: now_unix_ms().unwrap_or_default(),
```

`decide()` is called by:
- `RuntimePolicy::decide_unknown_feature()` (line 197)
- `RuntimePolicy::decide_join_admission()` (line 240)

All `DecisionRecord` instances carry potentially non-deterministic timestamps.

### 9.3 Remediation Plan

**Step 1: Add `Clock` trait (new file `crates/fp-runtime/src/clock.rs`).**

See section 4.1 for the full trait definition. The trait is NOT feature-gated.

**Step 2: Refactor `decide()` to accept a clock.**

```rust
// Before:
fn decide(
    mode: RuntimeMode,
    issue: CompatibilityIssue,
    prior_compatible: f64,
    loss: LossMatrix,
    evidence: Vec<EvidenceTerm>,
) -> DecisionRecord {
    // ...
    ts_unix_ms: now_unix_ms().unwrap_or_default(),
    // ...
}

// After:
fn decide(
    mode: RuntimeMode,
    issue: CompatibilityIssue,
    prior_compatible: f64,
    loss: LossMatrix,
    evidence: Vec<EvidenceTerm>,
    clock: &dyn Clock,
) -> DecisionRecord {
    // ...
    ts_unix_ms: clock.now_unix_ms().unwrap_or_default(),
    // ...
}
```

**Step 3: Update public API methods.**

`RuntimePolicy` gains a `clock` field or the methods accept `&dyn Clock`:

```rust
// Option A: Clock in method signature (minimal change)
pub fn decide_unknown_feature(
    &self,
    subject: impl Into<String>,
    detail: impl Into<String>,
    ledger: &mut EvidenceLedger,
    clock: &dyn Clock,
) -> DecisionAction { ... }

// Option B: Clock in RuntimePolicy (more ergonomic, avoids threading)
pub struct RuntimePolicy {
    pub mode: RuntimeMode,
    pub fail_closed_unknown_features: bool,
    pub hardened_join_row_cap: Option<usize>,
    clock: Box<dyn Clock>,
}
```

**Recommendation:** Option A (clock in method signature) for Phase 1. It is
the smallest API change and does not require `Box<dyn Clock>` allocation. The
`SystemClock` struct is zero-sized, so `&SystemClock` costs nothing.

**Step 4: Remove `now_unix_ms()` free function.**

After all callers are migrated to `Clock::now_unix_ms()`, delete the free
function. The `use std::time::{SystemTime, UNIX_EPOCH}` import moves into
`clock.rs` only.

**Step 5: Update fp-conformance.**

The `fp-conformance` crate has its own `now_unix_ms()` function (line 989 in
`lib.rs`). This should also be updated to accept a `Clock` parameter, but this
is a lower priority since fp-conformance is a test harness, not production code.

### 9.4 Code Locations That Need Changes

| File | Line(s) | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `crates/fp-runtime/src/lib.rs` | 2 | Remove `use std::time::{SystemTime, UNIX_EPOCH}` |
| `crates/fp-runtime/src/lib.rs` | 264-270 | Delete `now_unix_ms()` free function |
| `crates/fp-runtime/src/lib.rs` | 272-322 | Add `clock: &dyn Clock` parameter to `decide()` |
| `crates/fp-runtime/src/lib.rs` | 172-204 | Add `clock: &dyn Clock` to `decide_unknown_feature()` |
| `crates/fp-runtime/src/lib.rs` | 206-249 | Add `clock: &dyn Clock` to `decide_join_admission()` |
| `crates/fp-runtime/src/lib.rs` | 565-919 | Update all tests to pass `&SystemClock` or `&FakeClock` |
| `crates/fp-runtime/src/clock.rs` | (new) | `Clock` trait, `SystemClock`, `FakeClock` |
| `crates/fp-conformance/src/lib.rs` | 989 | Replace `now_unix_ms()` call with `Clock` (deferred) |

### 9.5 CI Audit Gate (Phase 3 of Remediation)

After remediation, add a CI lint to prevent regression:

```yaml
# In CI pipeline (e.g., .github/workflows/ci.yml):
- name: Audit ambient authority
  run: |
    # Deny direct SystemTime::now() and Instant::now() in fp-runtime
    if grep -rn 'SystemTime::now\|Instant::now' crates/fp-runtime/src/ \

## 10. Dependency Requirements

### 10.1 New Crate Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose | Feature-Gated | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `async-trait` | `#[async_trait]` for `TransportLayer` | Yes (`asupersync`) | Needed in Phase 2 |
| `sha2` | SHA-256 for integrity verification | No (already in fp-conformance) | Move to workspace dep |
| `hex` | Hex encoding for symbol data | No (already used in fp-conformance) | Move to workspace dep |

**Note:** `sha2` and `hex` are already transitive dependencies via `fp-conformance`.
Promoting them to workspace-level dependencies in the root `Cargo.toml` avoids
version duplication.

No new dependencies are required for Phase 1 (the Clock trait and codec trait
definitions are pure Rust with no external deps).

### 10.2 Feature Flag Design

```toml
# crates/fp-runtime/Cargo.toml (proposed)
[features]
default = []
asupersync = ["dep:asupersync"]
asupersync-transport = ["asupersync", "dep:async-trait"]
asupersync-full = ["asupersync", "asupersync-transport"]
```

| Feature | Pulls In | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| `asupersync` | `asupersync` crate (minimal) | Outcome bridge + codec + integrity |
| `asupersync-transport` | `async-trait` | Transport layer (async send/receive) |
| `asupersync-full` | All of the above | Complete ASUPERSYNC integration |

**Rationale:** Users who only need the outcome bridge and codec (synchronous,
no IO) should not pay for the async transport dependencies. The layered feature
flags allow progressive opt-in.

### 10.3 MSRV Implications

- `fp-runtime` uses `edition = "2024"`, requiring Rust 1.85+.
- `async-trait` requires Rust 1.75+ (well within the edition 2024 floor).
- `asupersync` 0.1.1 requires Rust 1.80+ (stated in its Cargo.toml).
- No MSRV concerns. All dependencies are compatible with the edition 2024 floor.

### 11.2 Integration Tests

| Test | Description | Modules Exercised |
|---|---|---|
| `encode_transfer_decode_verify` | Full pipeline: encode -> mock transport -> decode -> integrity verify | codec, transport, integrity |

| `conformance_sidecar_via_trait` | fp-conformance uses `ArtifactCodec` trait | codec, integrity, fp-conformance |

### 11.3 Property Tests

Using `proptest` or `quickcheck` (already available in workspace for property testing):

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `forall payload: encode(payload) -> decode -> payload` | Codec roundtrip for arbitrary payloads |
| `forall payload: hash(payload) == hash(payload)` | Hash determinism |
| `forall payload, symbols_dropped <= repair_count: decode succeeds` | Erasure coding recovery guarantee |
| `forall plan, attempt > max_retries: should_retry == false` | Recovery policy termination |

### 11.4 Conformance Harness Hooks

The `fp-conformance` crate currently keeps `raptorq` as its primary encoding
path, with an optional ASUPERSYNC hook path now implemented:

1. `fp-conformance` now exposes a crate feature forwarding to `fp-runtime/asupersync`.
2. `generate_raptorq_sidecar()` emits optional `asupersync_codec` evidence by
   running `PassthroughCodec::encode/decode` + `Fnv1aVerifier::verify` under
   feature-on builds.
3. `verify_raptorq_sidecar()` re-validates ASUPERSYNC integrity evidence under
   feature-on builds.
4. Existing `raptorq`-direct code paths remain the default fallback (feature off).

This ensures the conformance harness exercises the same code paths as production
ASUPERSYNC usage.

## 12. Appendix: Contract-to-Code Crosswalk

This table maps every behavioral contract and invariant from the ASUPERSYNC
artifact suite to specific Rust types, traits, and enforcement mechanisms.

## Drift Gates

This integration plan remains valid as long as:

1. `fp-runtime` remains the sole workspace crate with an `asupersync` dependency.
2. The `asupersync` crate version stays within `0.1.x` semver range.
3. `Outcome<T, E>` retains exactly four variants without `#[non_exhaustive]`.
4. `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` remains on `fp-runtime`.
5. The conformance harness (`fp-conformance`) continues to use the `raptorq` crate
   directly (until Phase 4 migration).
6. No other workspace crate introduces async runtime dependencies.

If any gate is violated, this document must be revised before proceeding with
the affected implementation phase.
